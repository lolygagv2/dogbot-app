# WIM-Z (Watchful Intelligent Mobile Zen) Product Roadmap including MObile App 
*Last Updated: January 2026*

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Build the world's first autonomous AI-powered pet training robot - the WIM-Z (Watchful Intelligent Mobile Zen) - that combines mobility, edge AI inference, and behavioral learning to create a premium pet care experience.

## 🏆 Strategic Positioning

### Must-Have Features to Lead Field
- **Robust AI pose + audio fusion** with intelligent reward logic
- **Return-to-dock charging** with fully autonomous missions
- **Multi-dog ID and behavior history** with individual profiles
- **Happy Pet Progress Report** - 1-5 bone scale grading system tracking:
  - Successful behaviors performed
  - Treats dispensed vs earned
  - Bark frequency analysis
- **Dual-mode camera system:**
  - Photography Mode: High-quality photos with AI presets
  - AI Detection Mode: Real-time behavior boxing and recognition
- **Behavioral Analysis Module** - Combined audio + vision synopsis

### High-Value Differentiators
- **True autonomous training sequences** - Not just scheduled dispensing
  - Example: "Sit 5 times today" with 3/5 random reward rate
  - Teaches 100% obedience with variable reinforcement
- **AI-curated social content** - Automatic best moments capture
- **Offline LLM capability** - Local command processing without internet
- **Open API architecture** - Third-party trainer/IoT integration

### The Killer Combo (Our Unique Moat)
1. ✅ True AI-powered autonomous training (not scheduled treats)
2. ✅ Individual dog recognition without collars (pose + ArUco)
3. ✅ Real-time pose detection with adaptive learning
4. ✅ Social media auto-posting (viral marketing built-in)
5. ✅ Multi-dog household support (competitors fail here)
6. ✅ Mobility + Edge AI + Training in ONE device

## 📊 Competitive Analysis

| Competitor | What They Do | What They're Missing | Our Advantage |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Furbo/Petcube** | Camera + treat toss | No mobility, no training AI | Mobile + AI training |
| **Anki Vector** | Cute robot companion | No dog training, discontinued | Pet-focused AI |
| **Treat&Train** | Stationary trainer | No mobility, no AI, manual only | Autonomous + mobile |
| **Robot vacuums** | Mobility + sensors | No pet interaction purpose | Purpose-built for pets |

**Our Positioning:** "WIM-Z - The first autonomous AI companion that moves, learns, and trains multiple pets independently"

## 🎯 Market Gap Analysis

Most AI pet robots (Sony Aibo, Tombot, Joy for All) simulate companionship for humans. WIM-Z's hybrid vision-audio reinforcement loop creates the first true **AI companion for animals**, not just humans.

- **Precision AI Focus:** Vision + sound fusion via Hailo-8 + IMX500
