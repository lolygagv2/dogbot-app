# WIM-Z Development TODO List
*Last Updated: June 2026 · Build 106*

## Current Status: Build 106 — Fleet Reliability Hardening

**Build Phase:** CORE COMPLETE — hardening + manufacturing prep
**Fleet:** 5 units (treatbot1–5) built & operational, one codebase + per-unit profiles
**Current Focus:** Reliability (power/freeze, timing), cloud-history correctness, per-unit calibration, validation of scheduler + summaries

---

## 🔥 CURRENT OPEN ITEMS (June 2026)

### Reliability / Safety (highest priority)
- [ ] **Silent hard-freeze RCA** — recurring lockups with no kernel/software trace (corrupt journal). Confirm power-delivery/brownout vs hang. Next step: capture `vcgencmd get_throttled` / PMIC after an event.
- [ ] **Power-button SPOF redesign** — GPIO21 relay gates the only power-off path behind a software watcher; a hang makes the button useless (must pull wire). Restore a hardware-direct OFF path.

### Validation (blocking "done" claims)
- [ ] **Mission Scheduler** — validate auto-start, time-window enforcement, once/daily/weekly logic (implemented, never tested)
- [ ] **Weekly Summary** accuracy — verify before it becomes an owner/investor metric
- [ ] End-to-end cloud history after service restart — SG run → bark/guardian/treat all appear in app history (fixes committed 3250698 / f18adb2, dormant until restart)

### Silent Guardian design decisions (user's call)
- [ ] Expose `treat_eligibility_cooldown` (hardcoded 600s in `silent_guardian.py:132`) to profile yaml
- [ ] Decide **post-cap behavior** — after the 11-treat session cap, SG keeps intervening but never rewards → possible behavior extinction over an 8h session

### Data / ML
- [ ] **Data refactor** — reshape all data into human/ML-friendly tables for analytics + continual learning. Design MD to be written first; do **not** start coding or backfill old rows yet (see memory: project_data_refactor).

## PRIORITY 3: Needs Rework/Testing

### Weekly Summary System (`core/weekly_summary.py`)

## AWS SNS Setup (Push Notifications)
```bash
# 1. Install boto3
pip install boto3

# 2. Configure AWS credentials (choose one method)
# Method A: AWS CLI
aws configure
# Enter: Access Key ID, Secret Key, Region (us-east-1 recommended for SMS)

# Method B: Environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"

# 3. Test the service
curl http://localhost:8000/notifications/health

# 4. Add a subscriber
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/notifications/subscribers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "morgan", "phone_number": "+15551234567"}'

# 5. Send test notification
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/notifications/test?user_id=morgan"
```

**AWS SMS Sandbox Note:**
New AWS accounts are in SMS sandbox mode. To send SMS:
- Option A: Verify destination phone numbers in AWS Console → SNS → Text messaging
- Option B: Request production access (takes 1-2 days approval)
